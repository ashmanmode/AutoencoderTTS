The Neural Network (NN) based Speech Synthesis System
=====================================================
  
This repository contains the Neural Network (NN) based Speech Synthesis System  
developed at the Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of 
Edinburgh. 

To build the toolkit: see `./INSTALL`.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux;

To run the example system builds, see `egs/README.txt`

As a first demo, please follow the scripts in `egs/slt_arctic`

Synthetic speech samples
------------------------

Listen to [synthetic speech samples](https://cstr-edinburgh.github.io/merlin/demo.html) from our demo voice.

Development pattern for contributors
------------------------------------

1. [Create a personal fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
   of the [main Merlin repository] (https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/merlin) in GitHub.
2. Make your changes in a named branch different from `master`, e.g. you create
   a branch `my-new-feature`.
3. [Generate a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
   through the Web interface of GitHub.
