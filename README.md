The Neural Network (NN) based Speech Synthesis System
=====================================================
  
This repository contains the Neural Network (NN) based Speech Synthesis System  
developed at the Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of 
Edinburgh. 

To build the toolkit: see `./INSTALL`.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux;

To run the example system builds, see `egs/README.txt`

As a first demo, please follow the scripts in `egs/slt_arctic`

Please visit [http://ashmanmode.github.io/dnntts] for listening to the synthesized waveforms on different databases and rate the waveforms based on their naturalness and similarity.
