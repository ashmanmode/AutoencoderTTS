Mapping features using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with application to Voice Conversion (VC). The implementations are on top of Theano Python library
Includes:

    - Deep Neural Networks with Dropout
   
    - Stacked Denoising Autoencoders
   

Requirements:

    1- numpy 2.7
   
    2- theano 0.6
