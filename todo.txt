1. Autoencoder -> change parameters on slt (Done)
2. Training with different size of dataset. on slt -> On Now
3. Objecive Testing PESQ -> On Now
4. Subjective Testing. (MOS Qlality)
5. HMM results

--> Only FFT Feats

Now I will add phase features here.

Problems:

1. If we break the signal into frames and then get fft for each frame,
try to concate the inverse fft of the same then we dont get the reconstructed signal in good form. 

[ASK] 2. With the new architecture [10*1024] and epo50_lr0.00005 we are getting good results, should I get the results for all other databases with this configuration.

3. So we have results over databases and different configurations over slt. 

[ASK] 4. For comparison we will need MOS scores for baseline as well as new architecture.
